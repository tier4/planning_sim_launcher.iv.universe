# Autoware Planning Simulator Launcher

Planning Simulator Launcher is being developed to assist in the definitive planning
simulation of Autoware.

Simulations are described in a YAML-based format called a "scenario".
The format has been specified at [Scenario Format Specification (TBU)](https://github.com/tier4/ScenarioFormat/blob/master/format/definition.md) .
This repository provides a reference implementation of the format's interpreter (Scenario Runner).

## 1. Setup

All the components needed to run the scenario, including this repository, are installed together in the AutowareArchitectureProposal setup.
See [https://github.com/tier4/AutowareArchitectureProposal#how-to-setup](https://github.com/tier4/AutowareArchitectureProposal#how-to-setup).

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Get Sample Scenario

Tested scenarios can be found at [https://github.com/tier4/planning_sim_launcher.iv.universe/tree/master/scenario](https://github.com/tier4/planning_sim_launcher.iv.universe/tree/master/scenario).
The examples placed in the repository tier4/ScenarioFormat are "examples of desired descriptions" and do not imply that this repository has already implemented them.

### 2.2 Procedure

#### (1) Make `scenario_database.json`

``` shell
cd /path/to/AutowareArchitectureProposal/src/simulator/planning_simulator_launcher
cp scenario_database_template.json scenario_database.json
```

#### (2) Edit `scenario_database.json`

Example:
```
{
    "launch_path" : "../scenario_runner/scenario_runner/launch/scenario_runner.launch",
    "log_output_base_dir" : "scenario/log/",
    "map" : {
        "kashiwanoha" : "/path/to/your/map/directory/kashiwanoha"
    },
    "scenario": [
        "scenario/total_test.yaml"
    ]
}
```

You can use the name of the map registered in the above json file as the value of the Map tag in the scenario file.
Alternatively, it is also possible to specify it directly by an absolute path.
Note that the Map path must be rewritten when sharing a scenario with multiple users when the value of the Map tag is specified by an absolute path.

#### (3) Execute


``` shell
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source /path/to/AutowareArchitectureProposal/install/setup.bash

ros2 run planning_simulator_launcher launch.py --timeout=180 && ros2 run planning_simulator_launcher show_result.py ./scenario/generated ./scenario/log
```
Command-line arguments of script `python show_result.py` is depends on the path you written in `scenario_database.json`.
1st argument is path to your directory your scenarios placed on + `/generated`.
2nd argument is path to your `log_output_base_dir` you written in `scenario_database.json`.

The argument "--timeout=180" given to launch.py is the time to force the simulation to quit.
This exists for situations where, for some reason, the simulation cannot satisfy either the Success or Failure conditions and the situation stalls.
An arbitrary integer can be specified for timeout. If this is not specified, 180 seconds is the default behavior.

## 3. Known Problems

### 3.1 The simulator is actually non-deterministic.

You get slightly different simulation results with each run.

### Action Supporting Status

| Private Action   | Ego | Vehicle | MotorBike | Bicycle | Pedestrian |
|:-----------------|:---:|:-------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| Acceleration     | -   | ✓       | ✓         | ✓       | ✓          |
| Enable           | -   | ✓       | ✓         | ✓       | ✓          |
| FollowRoute      | ✓   | ✓       | ✓         | ✓       | ✓          |
| FollowTrajectory | -   | -       | ✗         | ✗       | ✗          |
| LaneChange       | -   | ✓       | ✓         | ✓       | -          |
| Pose             | -   | ✗       | ✗         | ✗       | ✗          |
| RelativeSpeed    | -   | ✗       | ✗         | ✗       | ✗          |
| Speed            | (1) | ✓       | ✓         | ✓       | ✓          |

| Global Action    | Supporting |
|:-----------------|:----------:|
| ChangeSignal     | ✓          |

(1) Because Autoware calculates speed automatically, the scenario runner implicitly treats Speed Action for the Type: Ego entity as the maximum speed setting.

### Condition Supporting Status

| Logical Operator | Supporting |
|:-----------------|:----------:|
| All              | ✓          |
| Any              | ✓          |

| Private Condition | Ego | Vehicle | MotorBike | Bicycle | Pedestrian |
|:------------------|:---:|:-------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| Acceleration      | ✓   | ✓       | ✓         | ✓       | ✓          |
| CollisionByEntity | ✓   | ✓       | ✓         | ✓       | ✓          |
| CollisionByType   | ✗   | ✗       | ✗         | ✗       | ✗          |

| ReachPosition     | ✓   | ✓       | ✓         | ✓       | ✓          |
| RelativeDistance  | ✓   | ✓       | ✓         | ✓       | ✓          |
| Speed             | ✓   | ✓       | ✓         | ✓       | ✓          |

| Global Condition | Supporting |
|:-----------------|:----------:|
| Signal           | ✓          |
| SimulationTime   | ✓          |

## 5. Log file format

The log file was outputed into the directory which you targeted in the scenario_database.json.
Log file named as (scenario_id).json and (scenario_id).bag.
(scenario_id).json contains infomation like below.
move_distance is a move distance of the ego vehicle in the simulation.

```
    "metadata": {
        "scenario_id": "b56add4b-a5fb-46d7-bcc3-864a0590a17b",
        "start_datetime": "2020-05-27T05:17:20.276897",
        "end_datetime": "2020-05-27T05:18:29.850055",
        "duration": "69.573157929000004",
        "autoware_commit_hash": "",
        "simulator_commit_hash": "",
        "move_distance": "151.54248"
    },
```
